## Getting started with Raspberry Pi

It is recommended that you first read [this guide to learn how to set up a standalone Raspberry Pi](getting-started-guide.md) for the first time, if you are new to using the device, before reading on.

One way to use Raspberry Pi in the classsroom is as a standalone device that students can use outside of the school network to create programs and electronic projects, without fear of breaking expensive equipment or taking down an entire school network. It is an environment that allows for the freedom of failure, and it is through failing that students learn. If a file system becomes corrupted then it's okay, as you can always start again with a fresh SD card image. If you blow an LED, it doesn't matter.

Another appealing feature of the Raspberry Pi in education is that it looks interesting, and students ask questions about the hardware. How is it a computer? How does it work? What are input and output devices? Where does it store its software? and so on.

## Cross-curricular opportunities

Using Raspberry Pis in a classroom can also offer different ways of teaching and learning. It opens up the possibility of seeing computing more as a creative and maker-style activity. Computing can be a truly cross-curricular subject in Art, Science and Technology. Raspberry Pi can offer more than you realise in education.

## Teaching resources

With qualified teachers among our staff we are producing teaching materials, including full schemes of work that are cross-curricular, engaging, and satisfy the curriculum. They are published under a Creative Commons licence so that teachers can use them however they see fit.

- A great place to start is with our [Getting Started Lesson](http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-lesson/)

## Training

Here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation we offer FREE CPD for teachers as the Raspberry Pi Academy or Picademy for short. To find out more click on the links below:

## Asking the community

The Raspberry Pi Community is ready, willing and in most cases able to help schools teach Computing with Raspberry Pis. They are an often untapped source of experience and resources. If, after reading through this guide, you still cannot find solutions to your classroom problems, then it is recommended that you reach out to the community.

> When I started to use Raspberry Pis in my classroom in late 2012, the monitors were all VGA. At that time there was not a converter cable guaranteed to work, so I put a message out on Twitter asking if any local businesses were getting rid of any DVI monitors. Within a couple of minutes I had a response, and that weekend I collected the monitors I needed for free.

> The Raspberry Pi community is one of the most helpful I've ever been in contact with as a teacher. Using the [forums](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums) or Twitter with the hashtag `#raspberrypi` or `#picademy` could be a way to find solutions for your classroom too. ~ Carrie Anne Philbin

### The community page

On our website we feature prominent people and organisations within our community who are doing great outreach work. It is a good starting point to learn more about Raspberry Pi.

### The forum

If you have a question, whatever your level or experience, then you can ask it on our forum. We have an education section especially set up for this. It is an extremely friendly forum, where someone will answer your question very quickly and politely. A number of our Raspberry Pi Certified Educators are active on this forum, helping to answer questions and share good practice.
