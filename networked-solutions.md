## Networked solutions

You or your network administrators may wish to integrate Raspberry Pis more permanently into the school network. This is often a way to use existing hardware to connect to a Raspberry Pi, negating the need for extra monitors. Below are a number of ways of connecting to a Raspberry Pi using remote desktop software such as VNC, and a guide to using a Raspberry Pi terminal server as a solution to shared folders and SD card problems.
